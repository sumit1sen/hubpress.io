= Coursera's Data Science Specialization

I signed up for the courses in this specialization, not knowing if I will have the time to complete all (9) of them

The first course, "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" is an overview of the remaining courses and covers setting up RStudio and R.  It also has helpful hints for studying.

The first lecture of the 2nd week posed the following questions:

==== What do I hope to gain from this course?
I hope to learn more about

==== What challenges do I anticipate facing?
Lack of time due to work and family commitments

Getting stuck

==== What strategies will I use to overcome these challenges?
Set aside fixed blocks of time

I'll update this post later with my initial answers
